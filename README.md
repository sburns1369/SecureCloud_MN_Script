# SecureCloud_MN_Script
Installation Script for Installing up to 8 Ichiba Coin Masternodes

This script is for use on fresh installations of Ubuntu 16.04 x64 only; or Ubuntu 16.04 x64 installations that were installed by other Sburns/NullEntry (Github = https://github.com/sburns1369). All scripts where tested on a Vultr VPS

Script improvements where pushed with the latest update. If you have 3 masternodes, and want to have 4, select the installation script for 4 (assuming they where installed previously with my scripts) and it will detect the first 3 masternodes, and than prompt and build a 4th masternode, etc.

If all your masternodes go offline, just re-run the script to restart them as well. So if you want to restart 6 masternodes, select 6, and it will stop and re-start them.
